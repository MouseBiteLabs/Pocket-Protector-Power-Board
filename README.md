# Pocket Protector Power Board - UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This is a power regulator board for my <a href="https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/Game-Boy-Pocket-Color">Game Boy Pocket Color (MGBC)</a> project for use with LiPo batteries. But hey, have you seen my other regulator board, the <a href="https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/Pocket-Mouse-Power-Board">Pocket Mouser Power Board</a>? It's also really cool and doesn't use a battery that can explode.

## Important Things Before You Start

I highly suggest testing this board before installation in a Game Boy. Failure to do so may result in an irreversibly damaged Game Boy. See the testing sequence below.

**This is a complicated build that requires high level soldering skills. Please do not attempt if you do not have advanced soldering experience. Do not attempt to hand-solder the QFN components on this board, you must use a hot plate.**

**I am not responsible for any damage done to you, your Game Boy, or your dwelling. Lithium ion batteries are a huge fire hazard. You accept any and all risks associated with attempting this project.**

## Alternate LiPo Options

If you are at all doubting your ability to assemble this board, I recommend Nataliethenerd's Safer Charge DC, as it comes pre-assembled with everything you need: https://www.nataliethenerd.com/product-page/safer-charge-dc

<a href="https://www.nataliethenerd.com/product-page/safer-charge-dc"><img src="https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/Pocket-Protector-Power-Board/assets/97127539/2f21e403-e07e-4f55-aace-cad3eed82622" /></a>

Another option is to **have someone more skilled than you assemble the board for you.** I am not one of those people, but they certainly exist.

## Successful Build Requirements

In order to effectively, properly, and *safely* build this board, you really must:

1) Read this *entire* README thoroughly and carefully
2) Use a lithium ion battery that has an internal DW01 protection IC - **NO BARE CELLS**
3) Use a hot plate and solder paste for good part placement
4) Own a multimeter for testing voltages and measuring resistance/continuity
5) Have advanced soldering skills
6) Have modded a Game Boy console before
7) Have a lot of patience (do not rush!)
8) Double check the assembled board before final installment using the testing procedure below
9) Have homeowner's/renter's insurance

## Features

Some features of this power board include: 

* Changing the power switch to a "soft power switch," meaning the main power of the Game Boy does not flow through the switch. A dirty power switch can severly impact performance, so using this scheme can remedy that issue.
* Bootloop protection circuitry to prevent overdischarge of the battery past 3 V (a safe limit for lithium ion batteries), and to allow the Game Boy to die gracefully instead of violently stuttering until the regulator gives up.
* Load sharing (aka "power path") for charge-and-play capability.

This board was tested exclusively with this battery; any deviation from this one is 100% up to the user to determine compatibility: https://retrogamerepairshop.com/collections/gbp-power/products/102045-900mah-lipo-battery-cell?variant=40148887437484

**This battery includes a DW01 protection IC to prevent overcharge and deep overdischarge. Any battery used in this build must include a DW01 protection IC. This circuit board does not include these protections.**

## Testing and Installation Steps

Testing the assembled board *is mandatory.* If you have misassembled it, a part is incorrect, if there is a hidden solder bridge, or one of many other issues - your 5 V supply might be too high when you turn it on! This is not ideal for your Game Boy! But also, importantly, you may cause damage to your battery (which can explode). So you absolutely need to make sure everything is connected properly and working as expected.

### Equipment

1) You will need a multimeter to check resistances and voltages.
2) You should have some sort of power source, like a AA battery holder with alligator clips or benchtop power supply. *You can use the lithium ion battery to test, but I would recommend something a bit safer if possible.*
3) I highly recommend getting test leads with clips, like this: https://mou.sr/47Yeuae. They really make testing easier without having to solder wires on.

### Step 1: Top Side Assembly and Testing for Short Circuits

Assemble the top side parts using a hot plate and solder paste. **Do not assemble the bottom side yet.**

![image](https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/Pocket-Protector-Power-Board/assets/97127539/a43da905-4812-4adc-804f-7f06c126c039)

Afterwards, you'll want to check for short circuits on the charging IC (U3) with a multimeter. Finding them now will make your life much easier later. A short circuit will read as approximately 0 ohms on your multimeter. You can access (nearly) all the pertinent points via the backside of the PCB. See net definitions here:

![image](https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/Pocket-Protector-Power-Board/assets/97127539/58f502a5-179e-43c5-8655-e216db90307c)

Check to make sure the following measurements are not short circuited (0 ohms):

1) BT+ and VUSB
2) BT+ and GND
3) VUSB and R7
4) VUSB and GND
5) VUSB and VPOS
6) R9 and GND
7) R9 and VPOS
8) VPOS and SW
9) VPOS and VCC
10) VPOS and 5V
11) VPOS and DC
12) VPOS and BT+

One last set of measurements is to check R10 on the front side of the board.

1) Measure the resistance across the terminals of R10. It should read approximately 2.49 k立, +/- 1%.
2) Measure the resistance across the top terminal of R10 to the top terminal of R9 (on the back side of the board). Make sure it is not a short circuit.

Any measured short circuits indicates a solder bridge somewhere on the board, most likely on the QFN package.

### Step 2: Testing 5V Supply

The next step that will make your life easier later is to test the 5V generation handled by the *other* QFN device, U1.

1) Populate R5 on the backside of the board.
2) Connect pin 3 of the board to the negative end of a power source (like a battery holder or benchtop power supply).
3) Connect pins 1 and 2 (SW and VCC) to the positive side of the power source. Turn the switch on (if you have a switch).
4) Measure the 5V output - positive multimeter probe on pin 7 of the board, negative probe on GND.

If your voltage measures anything but 5V (+/-1%) then you have an issue. Probably a solder bridge underneath U1. Get to troubleshooting!

### Step 3: Populate the Back of the Board and Check Resistances

The bottom side of the board is easy to hand solder - this was done on purpose! ;)

![image](https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/Pocket-Protector-Power-Board/assets/97127539/483614f4-ae3b-46b6-92ac-5932b3801ade)

Then check these resistances with a multimeter:

1) Check R9. It must be approximately 10 k立.
2) Check R10. It must be approximately 2.49 k立.

This will also tell you if you have any new short circuits after assembling more parts. If you measure anything else, outside of a 1% margin, then something is wrong and it may be *dangerous* to use the board. Find the problem!

### Step 4: Preparing and Installing the USB-C Board

The USB-C breakout board sits on top of where the DC jack used to be. The board thickness should be 1.2mm for best fitment. 

1) Trim the legs of the USB-C port before soldering it in the board, so that the bottom of the board is a flush surface.
2) Solder in the port, then the 5.1k立 resistors R1 and R2.
3) Place the board on top of the MGBC board, line up the solder pads through the holes, and flow solder through all five holes to secure it to the board.

### Battery

As explained before, the battery you use **must** include a DW01 protection device. **DO NOT USE BARE CELLS**. Also note that the battery you order might be defective itself, so it is **up to you** to make sure it's safe. If your battery ever feels warm, or you measure voltages less than 2.45 V or greater than 4.2 V, the battery is defective and *should **not** be used*.

Testing was done exclusively with this battery: https://retrogamerepairshop.com/collections/gbp-power/products/102045-900mah-lipo-battery-cell?variant=40148887437484

## Potential Issues

- I really can't stress enough that this project needs to be done correctly. Lithium ion batteries are only as safe as you make them. I am also only one person; while I have tested this board a lot, there may be an inherent flaw I missed (this is another reason why it is mandatory to have a DW01 protection device on the battery).
